Make sure you have `antd` installed, then install:

```bash
$ npm install sunflower-antd --save
```

Sunflower includes different "Process Components", you can use different ones from "sunflower-antd".

eg:

```js
import { useFormTable } from 'sunflower-antd';
```

Visit ["Process Components"](process-components)
